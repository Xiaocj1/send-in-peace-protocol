## 🎯 What is this?
An autonomous socio-technical experiment that proposes an **identity-sovereign operating system paradigm**. We start by building applications that let you manage multiple, fully isolated digital personas—because your device should acknowledge your thousand faces.

It's not a product. It's a **test of a hypothesis**: Can clearly defined rules self-assemble a community to solve digital identity fragmentation?

## ⚙️ The Only Function of This Repo: Automatic Stewardship Transition
I (the initial author) do one thing: **hand over this repository's administrative rights to three community-elected stewards when conditions are met.**

### The Transition Protocol (Immutable Rules)
1.  **Trigger (Dual-Path):** Transition is triggered when **ANY ONE** of the following occurs:
    - **A. Consensus Attention:** This repository reaches **100 Stars**.
    - **B. Proof of Building:** A **verified working implementation** of the protocol principles is submitted via an `[Implementation]` Issue. This could be a standalone app implementing **L1 Identity Sovereignty (persona containers)**. It remains unchallenged for **14 days**.
2.  **Selection:** Upon trigger, the **5 users** who are (in order of priority):
    a. The **builder(s)** who submitted the triggering implementation (if triggered by Path B), **OR**
    b. Ranked **2nd to 6th** on the Star list at trigger time (if triggered by Path A, or if Path B has no identifiable builder).
    These 5 become "Blueprint Commissioners."
3.  **Contest:** Commissioners have **14 days** to submit their **"Send in Peace Protocol Development Blueprint"** in a designated Issue.
4.  **Election:** After submission, a **7-day community vote** is held. All contributors (PR submitters before the vote) are eligible to **vote to select 3 out of 5** commissioners.
5.  **Handover:** The top 3 vote-getters receive repository admin rights.
6.  **My Final Role:** After handover, I retain only the right to arbitrate on violations of the core principles in [GENESIS.md](GENESIS.md) using a pre-embedded PGP key.

## 🚀 How to Engage
- **Understand the vision & strategy:** Read the **[International Whitepaper](Whitepaper/en.md)** (or the [Chinese version](Whitepaper/zh-Hans.md)).
- **Understand the immutable principles:** Read [GENESIS.md](GENESIS.md).
- **Join the monthly design challenges:** Visit the **[Prototype Gallery](Prototype-Gallery/)** to participate in or review our monthly interaction/architecture prototypes.
- **The most meaningful contribution:** **Build your own implementation.** Create an app with "persona containers," then submit an `[Implementation]` Issue. This could trigger the governance transition.
- **Trigger the experiment:** **Star this repo** or **Build the first implementation.** Help us reach the threshold to witness a rule-based governance handover.

## 🎨 Prototype Gallery (New!)
We believe in showing, not just telling. Each month, we explore a different aspect of the protocol through interactive prototypes and design challenges.

**Current Challenge (May 2024):** [Identity Switcher Interaction Paradigms](Prototype-Gallery/2024-05-Identity-Switcher/)

*How would you design the experience of switching between your "Work", "Family", and "True Self" personas?*

## ❓ Why This Design?
This is a **real-time test**: Can a compelling vision + fair initial rules + a clear MVP-first strategy = a self-assembling community?

The perfect app isn't here yet. The full community isn't here yet. **But the first prototypes are, and the rules are live.**

*This protocol belongs to anyone who needs it. The rules are the only authority.*
