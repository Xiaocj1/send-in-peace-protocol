## 🎯 What is this?
A socio-technical protocol proposal to address **context collapse** and **digital identity fragmentation**. It's an autonomous experiment, not a product.

## ⚙️ The Only Function of This Repo: Automatic Stewardship Transition
I (the initial author) do one thing: **hand over this repository's administrative rights to three community-elected stewards when conditions are met.**

### The Transition Protocol (Immutable Rules)
1.  **Trigger (Dual-Path):** Transition is triggered when **ANY ONE** of the following occurs:
    - **A. Consensus Attention:** This repository reaches **100 Stars**.
    - **B. Proof of Building:** A **verified working implementation** of the protocol principles is submitted via an `[Implementation]` Issue, and remains unchallenged for **14 days**.
2.  **Selection:** Upon trigger, the **5 users** who are (in order of priority):
    a. The **builder(s)** who submitted the triggering implementation (if triggered by Path B), **OR**
    b. Ranked **2nd to 6th** on the Star list at trigger time (if triggered by Path A, or if Path B has no identifiable builder).
    These 5 become "Blueprint Commissioners."
3.  **Contest:** Commissioners have **14 days** to submit their **"Send in Peace Protocol Development Blueprint"** in a designated Issue.
4.  **Election:** After submission, a **7-day community vote** is held. All contributors (PR submitters before the vote) are eligible to **vote to select 3 out of 5** commissioners.
5.  **Handover:** The top 3 vote-getters receive repository admin rights.
6.  **My Final Role:** After handover, I retain only the right to arbitrate on violations of the core principles in [GENESIS.md](GENESIS.md) using a pre-embedded PGP key.

## 🚀 How to Engage
- **To understand the problem & vision:** Read the [Whitepaper](Whitepaper/en.md).
- **To understand the core principles:** Read [GENESIS.md](GENESIS.md).
- **To contribute:** The most meaningful contribution is **to start your own implementation.** Create your own repo, build your vision, and state it's "inspired by the Send in Peace Protocol principles."
- **To trigger the experiment:** **Star this repo** or **Build the first implementation.** Help us reach the threshold to witness and participate in a fully transparent, rule-based governance handover.

## ❓ Why This Design?
This is a **test of a hypothesis**: Can a clearly defined problem, a compelling vision, and a perfectly fair set of initial rules self-assemble a community and transition to full autonomy without a central founder?

The code isn't here. The community isn't here (yet). **The potential is.**

*This protocol belongs to anyone who needs it, not to any individual. The rules are the only authority.*
