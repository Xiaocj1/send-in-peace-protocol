# Governance Transition: From Stewardship to Autonomy

## Trigger Mechanism for the First Election
To ensure a smooth transition from founder-led stewardship to community autonomy, the election for the first Provisional Convener Council will be triggered when **ANY ONE** of the following conditions is met:

### Condition A: Consensus of Attention
This repository reaches **100 stars** on GitHub.

### Condition B: Proof of Life (via Building)
A verifiable, publicly usable software implementation that adheres to the three principles in `GENESIS.md` is created, and its builder submits an Issue to this repository with the title:
`[Implementation] <Project Name>`

**Verification Process:**
The submitted Issue will be open for community review for **14 days**. If no core contributor raises a substantive objection based on the `GENESIS.md` principles, the implementation is deemed valid and the condition is met.

## Post-Trigger Process
1.  Upon meeting a condition, the founders will announce the start of a **30-day nomination and election period**.
2.  Elections will be conducted via a transparent, community-agreed method (detailed in the first election announcement).
3.  The elected Provisional Convener Council will then assume stewardship and begin drafting the first formal community governance framework.

*This process ensures that progress is driven either by widespread interest or by tangible proof of the protocol's viability.*
